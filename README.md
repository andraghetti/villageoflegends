## [![Lua](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lua-2244FF?logo=lua)](https://www.lua.org/)   Lua source code

The game has been created using [Tabletop Simulator API](https://api.tabletopsimulator.com/).
The source code is in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html) and it has two modes:

- [PvP mode](src/pvp/README.md)
- [Coop mode](src/coop/README.md)

Each directory contains the lua scripts relative to in-game objects. If you need to use the code, I suggest you to copy paste the code that you need into the object that are in your own workshop.
